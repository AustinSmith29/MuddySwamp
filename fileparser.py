General approach: Build objects based on static traits (name, description, etc.)
Dependencies are deferred until after the fact
This highlights a key note: that all dynamic attributes (i.e. attributes
defined in other files, or redefined at run time) should not be included
in the constructor.
Example:
Exits should be added after locations are made. Items should be added
to locations after locations and items are both made.
