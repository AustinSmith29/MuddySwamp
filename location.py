class Exit:
    '''Class representing an Exit
    Exits link a set of names with a particular location
    Contains: 
        a list of strings [exit names]
        destination [the location this points to]
    There are also several variables involved with filtering:
        _whitelist - players and classes allowed through
        _blacklist - players and classes forbidden
        closed - set True to close this exit to EVERYONE
        restricted - True to apply restrictions; False if unrestricted
        assume_include -what happens to players neither in whitelist|blacklist
            If True: players not in lists are allowed in
            If False: players not in lists are forbidden
    The list can be accessed by treating the this as an iterable
    For instance:
        "exit_name" in myExit [returns true if "exit_name" is in exit]
        for exit_name in myExit:
            [iterates over all the possible exit names]
    For accessibility manipulation:
        exit << thing [true if exit is accessible to thing]
        exit += thing [include thing in exit]
        exit -= thing [exclude thing in exit]
